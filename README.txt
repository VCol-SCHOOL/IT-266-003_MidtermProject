The beat'em up mod turns Quake 4 to fit a brawler-esc type of combat (hence the name)

basic controls are the same however only a couple of key binds have changed

- left-click - fires off a jab (light hitscan)
- right-click - delivers a kick (heavy spread out hitscan)
- e - fires off a projectile (determined by the shop)
- q - puts the player into a blocking state (take no damage, but you are slow and can't attack)
(to unblock press q again)

Another feature of note is the new powerups added for this mod:

- uber - gain a small temporary boost in attack, health, and speed
- smooth - gain quicker movements and take no damage for a limited time
- drain - Gain an extreme attack boost at the cost of health for a limited time
- accumulate (or accum) - slow down and slowly gain both health and armor past the health limit for a limited time
- absorb - for a brief period turn any incoming damage into health

Deliverables
- Brawler combat mechanics (1 block, 3 attacks)
- 5 custom powerups
- Enemy Ai using brawling attacks
- Special moves unlocked from the buy menu (4 of those)
- Broken (expectation) boss battle
